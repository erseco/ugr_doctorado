	abstract = {Some free software and open source projects have been extremely successful in the past. The success of a project is often related to the number of developers it can attract: a larger community of developers (the ‘bazaar’) identifies and corrects more software defects and adds more features via a peer-review process. In this paper two free software projects (Wine and Arla) are empirically explored in order to characterize their software lifecycle, development processes and communities. Both the projects show a phase where the number of active developers and the actual work performed on the system is constant, or does not grow: we argued that this phase corresponds to the one termed ‘cathedral’ in the literature. One of the two projects (Wine) shows also a second phase: a sudden growing amount of developers corresponds to a similar growing output produced: we termed this as the ‘bazaar’ phase, and we also argued that this phase was not achieved for the other system. A further analysis revealed that the transition between ‘cathedral’ and ‘bazaar’ was a phase by itself in Wine, achieved by creating a growing amount of new modules, which attracted new developers.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Software development teams eventually become complex systems reaching a critical state, a fact that has already been proved by several researchers. This state, reached by self-organization, is characterized by three conditions applied to the sequence of changes: a scale-free structure, long-distance correlations, and so-called pink noise. In this paper, we use a new methodology to measure whether this self-organized critical ({SOC}) state actually exists. Instead of focusing in a single and long-running project as is usual, we will rather work on 16 different repositories with different sizes and ages, and use a novel, more natural and precise methodology to examine the sizes of changes. Our research shows that in all 16 repositories analyzed, at least one of the {SOC} characteristics exists, and most of them exhibit all three, which leads us to think that {SOC} is more widespread in software development than previously thought and that very few initial conditions might be needed to reach it.},

Here we will describe a teaching experience based on agile principles that puts students at the center of a strategy that, through the use of fit learning analytics, is able to optimize the potential of a class and its individual students. We used project-based learning and formative evaluation as agile teaching best practices, evaluating student progress based on learning objectives submitted and evaluated asynchronously. The time when every objective is submitted and the time taken to pass it are the essential data points that will be leveraged to evaluate class progress, and the impact of specific measures taken to improve it, in-class or from one course to the next. Measures taken through three years with the same methodology prove that agile teaching can work, but it needs measurements for diagnosis and subsequent interventions to reach its full potential.},

	abstract = {— E-Content is a very power full tool of higher education.
E-content is valuable to the learners and also helpful to teachers of all individual instruction systems. E-content is the latest method of instruction that has attracted more attention to gather with the concept of models.
Switching from traditional textbooks to digital course materials is a growing trend in higher education. This development has many
advantages for students and faculty in greater interactivity,
customizability, and opportunities for social collaboration. Many of the products offered in today's e-content marketplace are shifting
from proprietary apps to open standards such as {HTML}5. Openstandard products and software offer many of the same features
as closed applications but provide the additional benefit of working
across the most common device platforms. Open-standard
products and software also allow for greater longevity, since the econtent can continue to be accessed through various devices even
as technologies develop further. Contents used in education can
be from a number of sources: {eJournals}, {eBooks} {eResearchreports}, electronic {eLecture}-modules, {eLecturenotes}, and
{eLecture}-slides. This paper discusses a number of open source
tools for the development of {eContent}. Some of the Open source
tools that are freely available for e-content development such as
Xerte, {eXe}, {GLO} Maker, Courselab, {LAMS}, etc are discussed. The
advantages, as well as the disadvantages of such open source
tools are analysed. And various ways on {howeContent} can be
promoted and used through the Internet are discussed},

Las herramientas de autor son aplicaciones informáticas que facilitan a los usuarios la creación, publicación y gestión de materiales educativos en formato digital, para ser utilizados en educación a distancia mediada por {TICs}. Estas herramientas generan materiales que una vez compilados y exportados funcionan de forma independiente del programa que los generó. Permiten crear materiales multimedia, combinando contenido textual con imágenes, sonido, videos y actividades interactivas, desde una interfaz amigable e intuitiva, que no requiere conocimientos de programación, ya que se basan en un conjunto de plantillas predeterminadas y cuentan con posibilidades de personalización, además de guías y ayudas para su uso. El carácter gratuito y de código abierto de {eXeLearning}, juntamente con sus amplias prestaciones, lo convalidó como herramienta de elección para el desarrollo de un curso destinado a la formación de profesores con el objetivo de ampliar las capacidades estratégicas de los docentes en el uso de tecnología informática aplicada en educación, promoviendo la producción, utilización y reutilización de {REA}. El curso teórico-práctico sobre el manejo de {eXeLearning} forma parte del “Ciclo de formación para la gestión de proyectos de Educación a distancia”, desarrollado por la Dirección General de Educación a Distancia de la Universidad Nacional de la Plata.},
